The CSA is a collaboration of scientists, software developers and educators who 
collectively develop, manage and utilise internet-based citizen science projects 
in order to further science itself, and the public understanding of both science 
and of the scientific process. These projects use the time, abilities and 
energies of a distributed community of citizen scientists who are our collaborators.
